📝 To-Do List Management System (C++)

A console-based To-Do List Management System built in C++, using file handling and structured programming to provide user authentication and personal task management.
Each user can register, log in, add, edit, delete, search, and track tasks — all saved persistently in text files.

🚀 Features
👤 User Management

Register new users (each has their own task file).

Login securely using username and password.

Change Password anytime.

✅ Task Management

Add Tasks with title, details, due date, and priority.

Edit Tasks to update details or priority.

Delete Tasks (single or all).

Mark Tasks as Done once completed.

Search Tasks by title, priority, due date, or index.

📅 Task Insights

Display All Tasks (done and pending).

View Completed Tasks.

Show Overdue Tasks (based on current date).

View Tasks Due Today.

💾 Data Persistence

All user credentials are stored in users.txt.

Each user’s tasks are stored in a personal text file named after their username (e.g. hagar.txt).

🧱 Project Structure
📂 ToDoListSystem/
├── main.cpp              # Main source file (contains all program logic)
├── users.txt             # Stores registered users' login data
├── <username>.txt        # Stores tasks for each user
└── README.md             # Project documentation

⚙️ How It Works

Run the program.

Choose one of the options:

Login

Register

Exit

Once logged in, a menu allows you to manage tasks (add, edit, delete, etc.).

Tasks are saved automatically to your personal file for future sessions.

🧠 Concepts Used

Structs for User, Task, and Date

File handling using <fstream> for saving/loading data

Arrays for managing multiple users and tasks

Functions for modular, organized code

Recursion for error handling in menu navigation

Date handling using <ctime>

🧩 Future Enhancements

 Replace text files with a database (like SQLite).

 Add task categories (Work, Study, Personal).

 Add reminders or notifications.

 Introduce color-coded priorities in the console.

 Build a GUI version using Qt or C++ WinForms.

Got it ✅ — here’s your clean and professional README.md where it simply says it’s a group project, without listing team members individually:
